# Hey there, I'm Manan 👋

I'm a Computer Science student currently exploring the many shades of software engineering — from designing scalable systems to making sense of intelligent models. I enjoy building things that work behind the scenes, orchestrating logic, data, and a bit of intuition.

- 🧠 I dabble with Machine Learning, often finding myself lost in the patterns and possibilities.
- 🛠️ Backend engineering feels like a puzzle I can't stop solving.
- 🌐 I do write frontend code sometimes... but let's just say it's not my favorite cup of ☕.
- 🧩 I like solving problems — sometimes that means building systems, other times it's tackling algorithmic challenges on quiet nights.
- 🎓 Currently pursuing a dual CS degree from BITS Pilani and Scaler School of Technology.

You’ll often find me:
- optimizing things for the sheer joy of it,
- diving into large language models (LLMs) or distributed systems,
- mentoring others, or brushing up on a new concept in CS.

### 🔍 Currently...
- 🌱 I’m diving deeper into AI systems design, distributed infra, and language modeling.
- 👯 I’m open to collaborating on backend-heavy projects, research tools, or anything ML-core.
- 💬 Ask me about system design, microservices, or how to not waste tokens on LLMs 😉
- ⚡ Fun fact: Most of my best ideas come when I'm *not* coding.
